# Hi Haymarket!

This is the code created from having done your assessment. It took roughly
2 hours to complete and I did it using:

- Gulp (for running tasks)
- Handlebars (for templating)
- jQuery (for triggering the template code on load of page)
- SCSS (for styling the page)
- Skeleton (for providing a minimal CSS framework - my first time using it!)
- Bootstrap (for the basis of the carousel)
